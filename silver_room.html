  <h1>⋆✴︎˚｡⋆The Silver Chamber⋆✴︎˚｡⋆</h1>
  <p>You move deeper into the silver portal. The hallway fades and you're standing in a chamber made entirely of angled mirrors. Outside them: stars.</p>

  <p>Your reflection tilts endlessly in every direction. Hanging midair is a silver-bound notebook filled with sketches. One sketch pulses faintly.</p>

  <p>Do you want to:</p>

  <div class="choices">
  <a href="silver_study.html">Sit and study the sketch</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <a href="silver_walk.html">Walk through the mirrored doorway</a>
</div>
</body>
